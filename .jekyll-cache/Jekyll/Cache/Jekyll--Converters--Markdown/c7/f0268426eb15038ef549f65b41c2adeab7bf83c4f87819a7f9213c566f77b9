I"ü<p>I have worked on supporting sexual minorities rights in the Middle East.
I created a Facebook group called ‚ÄôHealth survey of Arab Men who have sex with men‚Äô
aiming to survey health issues among sexual minorities in the Middle East. The group
provides health awareness and online data about Egyptian gays in the Middle East. I
extended my work by developing a research project aiming to describe the current
situation of sexual minorities in Egypt, how they can be reached and their health and
psychological behaviors. My paper entitled ‚ÄúReaching Egyptian gays using social media:
A comprehensive health study and a framework for future research‚Äù got accepted
recently by Journal of Homosexuality.</p>

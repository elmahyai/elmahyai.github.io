<p><a href="http://localhost:4000/certificates/Statistical Inference.pdf">Statistical Inference</a>  by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. Certificate
earned on March 16, 2016</p>

<p>Duration:
Approx. 16 hours to complete
Suggested: 5 hours/week</p>

<p>Description:
Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, ‚Ä¶) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:4000/certificates/Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis.pdf">Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis</a>  by University of California,
Santa Cruz on Coursera. Certificate earned on October 2, 2016</p>

<p>Duration: Approx. 21 hours to complete
Suggested: Four weeks of study, two-five hours/week depending on your familiarity with mathematical statistics.</p>

<p>Description:
This course introduces the Bayesian approach to statistics, starting with the concept of probability and moving to the analysis of data. We will learn about the philosophy of the Bayesian approach as well as how to implement it for common types of data. We will compare the Bayesian approach to the more commonly-taught Frequentist approach, and see some of the benefits of the Bayesian approach. In particular, the Bayesian approach allows for better accounting of uncertainty, results that have more intuitive and interpretable meaning, and more explicit statements of assumptions. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. For computing, you have the choice of using Microsoft Excel or the open-source, freely available statistical package R, with equivalent content for both options. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development as well as explanations of philosophy and interpretation. Completion of this course will give you an understanding of the concepts of the Bayesian approach, understanding the key differences between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches, and the ability to do basic data analyses.</p>

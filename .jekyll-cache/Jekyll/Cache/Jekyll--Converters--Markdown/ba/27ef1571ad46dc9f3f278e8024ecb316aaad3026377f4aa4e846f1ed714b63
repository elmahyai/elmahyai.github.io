I"W	<p>Recently, I won a fellowship from Bayer foundation to work on RNAseq based classification of complex diseases at Institute of computational biology, helmholtz Zentrum, munich, Germany . The fellowship will be from 1 January 2018 till 30 June 2018.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Identification of gene expression patterns associated with complex diseases has revolutionized Medicine. Combined with machine learning algorithms, gene expression analysis improved our
diagnosis capability dramatically. A popular example is the identification of 50 significant
genes known as PAM50 for classification of breast cancer which revolutionized breast
cancer diagnosis and treatment. Identifying the molecular profiles of diseases not only
allows accurate and early diagnosis, but also helps understanding the mechanisms and
molecular pathways behind diseases. Such pathways represent the main target of many
therapeutic agents which lead to a more accurate and personalized treatment. Accuracy
is very important in Medicine and diagnosis based only on patients symptoms is very
susceptible to error and subjective bias. On the other side, molecular data provides a
powerful objective tool that if combined with domain knowledge will lead us to make
better clinical decisions. Inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis are very well
known now to have a strong genetic predisposition. We will identify the molecular
signature of inflammatory skin diseases through gene expression data that we already
have in a processed form from diseased as well as normal skin. The purpose of this
project is to identify molecular markers that drive the diagnosis of inflammatory skin
diseases and build a classifier that physicians can use in clinical settings. We will
develop algorithms to identify key genes that can robustly differentiate between
different diseases. Next, we will use these genes to develop an ensemble of classifiers
to predict the diagnosis of new cases. Finally, we will provide our classifier in the form
of a web application to be used for diagnosis and validate it with medical doctors.</p>

## MBBCh
Yes I finished six years of Medicine and Surgery. I will be doing the obligatory medical internship year as soon as possible. Then, I will get the medical licence. At Alexandria University, Faculty of Medicine, I met amazing friends, mentors and patients.

## Solved a problem
Designed a script for my medical school to solve an educational problem to
save hours of manual distribution of students to elective courses. Its code is available
on [github](https://www.github.com/elmahyai/elective). It has been used in the passed two years until we improve our elective courses system.

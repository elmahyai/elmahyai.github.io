title: I can translate :)

Transferring knowledge to the Middle East is one of my big concerns. I am very interested in the intelligent design vs. evolution debate in
the west. I started a team aiming to transfer this important debate to the Middle East.
We have translated several books (currently over seven books and the project is still
ongoing). I was a main translator of the book”Icons of Evolution" by Jonathan wells. The
book is published by Dar El­kateb in 2015 (Publisher contact: info@braheen.com). This
experience added a lot to my personality in terms of debate and communication skills.
